Greetings my fellow hearth**kings**, today I bring before you the humble, yet very useful Miner.

The more your Miners mine, the better they get at it. I have a desert settlement megaproject, which involves digging a whole bunch of land around a small lake, to make it a water-filled mountain. But it was taking FOREEEVERRR! So I made this class to speed things up.  

Stonehearth appears to have a Miner class within its files, as well, but all I used from it was the miner icon itself. It's been sitting there for more than a few years now, untouched. I have no idea when Team Radiant will get around to it, so until they do, this will have to suffice.  

**Features**

* Pickaxe created by Blacksmith at level 1 to promote
* Mines faster than regular hearthlings, with further speed increases at levels 3 and 6
* Backpack affords expanded inventory for all that ore
* Levelling progression includes speed upgrades as well - perfect for hauling when there are no mining tasks
* **Cannot build**, so you still need workers for that

**Coming soon**
* More equipment (pickaxes, mining hammers, lantern)
* Pickaxe always visible
* Hearthling stats affect job ability
* More experience gained when mining ore veins, ore more frequently found by higher-level miners

**Known issues**
* Hearthling portrait sometimes flashes when the miner is mining.
* Your modder is a neophyte. There may be more bugs I haven't found yet.

All feedback is appreciated, but in particular, I'd like to hear about balancing: does the miner gain XP at a good rate? Does he mine too quickly? Too slowly? Additionally, you can see that I am not a very good artist. If you have a bit of free time, and have a good idea of what the miner could look like, please let me know. The current costume is just the reskinned and slightly modified trader outfit.

**Credits**
Thank you to @max99x for providing invaluable documentation on the AI system, as well as being an excellent unwilling rubber ducky. Thank you to @BrunoSupremo for his Archipelago mod, the largest up-to-date mod I am aware of, that I used as a reference. Special mention to @RepeatPan for all his past help and encouragement. And thank you of course Team Radiant for this fantastic game. I've used the trader outfit models, as well as some lua files, from the base game.
